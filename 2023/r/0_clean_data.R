# R version 3.6.3 (2020-02-29)
# Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)

# R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) 
# Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)

# There are two 0_ scripts: This one is used if data is queried externally
# from R. It (should) produce the same files in the same locations. Queries
# stored in seak_sablefish/sql/chatham_sablefish_queries_20210121.sql (these are
# the same (or very similar) to the queries in 0_querynclean_data.R). The few
# differences between the queries include some sql joins to simplify the
# queries.

# Note 20210127: I had to modify code to bring date/time fields in, i.e.
# ymd(parse_date_time(CATCH_DATE, c("%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S %p"))). If this ever
# happens again, which it probably will because date/times are notoriously
# annoying in R, keep in mind that your end goal is to get the date into ISO
# 8601 format or YEAR-MONTH-DAY (e.g. 2021-01-27).

# All final columns formatted as follows unless otherwise specified:
# length: fork length, cm
# weight: kg
# Maturity: "0" = immature, "1" = mature
# depth: average depth, meters
# date: ISO 8601 YYYY/MM/DD
# characters & factors - first letter capitilized (e.g. 'Sex'), otherwise lowercase
# lat and lon are in decimal degrees
# catch - varies between whole_pounds or whole_kg depending on what its being used for

# most recent year of data

# 2. Fishery cpue ----

# The fishery CPUE index will not be available for 2020, and the following
# documentation serves as a placeholder. The commented out code below can be
# used to standardize future column names to maintain some consistency with
# existing code.

# Current documentation: In 2020, Rhea Ehresmann and GF project staff worked
# with Karl Wood to create a new cpue data input application. As part, they
# redefined how set targets are defined. This means Kallenburger's scripts that
# match fish ticket poundage data to logbook data are likely depricated and will
# need a revamp. If this is the case, my recommendation is to work with Justin
# Daily and the new biometrician to develop new methods (ideally in R). In the
# mean time, the statistical catch-at-age model will accept NULLS for this data
# component. This part of the model likelihood receives a relatively low weight,
# so I anticipate this will have little influence on model results. The full
# time series will need to be redeveloped once this has happened.

# Past documentation: Kamala Carroll pulls the IFDB view out_g_log_longline_c_e,
# populates new columns effort_target_species_code and effort_comments, and
# sends to Scott Johnson. Scott runs a series of Martina Kallenburger's sql
# scripts (https://github.com/commfish/seak_sablefish/issues/7) that match fish
# tickets pounds back to set based on Kamala's set target designation based on
# some undocumented methodology (proportional to numbers/pounds in logbook?). It
# lives in a view called sablefish_cpue_final_view in scottj's IFDB schema,
# though he has made a public synonym for it. This output doesn't contain
# information on sets designated as halibut targets. Note that it is missing
# effort_no's (effort_no's = individual sets).

#A) This code is for adding both 2020 and 20201 data at once since 2020 was skipped last year

# 4. Longline survey cpue ----

# 2020-01-28: (i.e. "v2") Attempt to do a better job cleaning up the data based
# on comments. Invalidate: skates with >= 12 invalid hooks (should be done
# already), large snarls, clothelined skates, control for bycatch, sleeper
# sharks. This was an ongoing effort,
# so it's worth pulling the full data set. The file is saved as "v2" because the data
# are different than past years, which were not QAQCed as thoroughly, but that can and
# probably should be changed in the future. Once these data are stable, you can modify the 
# query and R code to only pull the current year of data and merge it to past years.

# Other documentation: There are two longline survey CPUE views: For CPUE you want
# output.out_g_sur_longline_hook_acc_bi. out_g_sur_longline_hook_acc_bi sums the
# total number of sablefish while out_g_sur_longline_catch_bi splits out by
# retained, lost, discard, etc. For the 2017 assessment (2018 forecast) I used
# the correct view for CPUE calculation but the incorrect one in the
# mark-recapture models #3 and #4. These were not used for management, and the
# code has been corrected for the 2018 assessments. The other view is used for
# mark-recapture purposes because all retained fish are checked for marks/tags.

# 7. Pot survey biological ----

# The pot survey is a mark-recapture survey. Limited bio data exists. Use this
# data for two purposes: 1) the bio data, and 2) determining the number of marks
# deployed into the fishery in a given year and which batch_no the tags are
# from.

# *FLAG* this query currently only has age-sex-size data in 2009. There's also
# an IFDB view called out_g_bio_eff_age_sex_size_tag. Asked S. Johnson
# 2018-02-16 what the difference between the two views is. He said "These two
# views are almost identical. out_g_bio_eff_age_sex_size_tag is created by the
# following SQL: 'CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW OUT_G_BIO_EFF_AGE_SEX_SIZE_TAG AS
# select *  from out_g_bio_effort_age_sex_size where length(tag_no) > 2'. This
# omits the "T-" entries which are fish that were sampled but not tagged. The
# _tag view only includes fish that were tagged.

# The out_g_bio_effort_age_sex_size view has all the biological samples for the
# pot surveys, and includes fish that were not tagged (tag_no = 'T-').

# Updated query 20200124 to include project code = 66, the experimental code
# used for the 2019 (and 2020) escape ring studies

# Daily accounting of observed fish and tag recoveries in the NSEI fishery.

# spreadsheets with inconsistent data types (one column can have empty cells,
# Yes, yes, N/A, NA, etc.) in M:/SABLEFISH/CHATHAM/<year>/Port Sampling port daily
# summary.xlxs. There are equivalent 2003 data but I don't know where they're
# stored. Asked Mike Vaughn if he'd look for them on 2018-02-16. It has been
# confirmed that these data are lost. I worked with Amy Jo Linsley in PB to
# clean these up and convert them to csvs, but there were lots of errors (e.g.
# missing values that could have been filled in using fish ticket or logbook
# data, incorrect trip_nos, or duplicate records). These were all fixed by hand.
# It's also impossible to tell which records were omitted for analysis in a
# given year, which is probably why KVK's numbers don't match up with past
# numbers and won't match up with mine either.

# Follow up Feb 2018: The spreadsheet was in poor shape again this year. I have
# followed up several times about 2003 data and can confirm now that it is lost.
# I've impressed on A. Olson the importance that these data be entered and
# stored in a safer way.

# Follow up Dec 2019 with Rhea Ehresmann (new GFP leader): Goal to move these to
# Zander in 2020. M. Vaughn also indicated there are countback data going back
# to 1997.

# Now that these data are finalized, add on each year:
# PJ22: no countbacks in 2021... need tocheck on this -pj22
#not important for 2021 bc there was no marking survye
# however, if open model is attempted this will be needed - pj22
