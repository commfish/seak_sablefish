# Conduct MR annual estimates using data >= 2005. 2003 countbacks were partially
# lost, 2004 used PIT tags and batch 15 (2004) recoveries aren't in database.
# Other MR data go back to 1997, but these data haven't been recovered.

# NOTE: The mark-recap models take awhile to run. Allot some time to this.

# Past release: https://github.com/commfish/seak_sablefish/releases/tag/mark-recapture-pre-2019-assessment
# Issue on survey countbacks: https://github.com/commfish/seak_sablefish/issues/39

# Variable definitions ----

# N.0 = number of sablefish in Chatham Strait at time of marking
# K   = number of marks released
# K.0 = number of marks released after tagging of small fish has been accounted for 
# D.0 = number of marks that are not available to either the LL survey or to the fishery
# D_i = number of tags lost in a time period that should be decremented from the
#       next time period
# i = subscript for time period i, which may refer to the LL survey (i = 1)
#        to one of the fishery time periods based on time of landing
# N_i = number of sablefish in Chatham Strait at the beginning of time period i
# K_i = number of marked sablefish in Chatham Straight at the beginning of time period i
# t_i = total number of days in time period i
# n_i = observed catch (number of marked and unmarked sablefish that were
#       checked for clips, or tags in the LL survey) during period i
# k_i = number of marked fish recovered in period i (tags in the LL survey)

# Past assessments ----

# FLAG TO DO! A summary of past estimated abundance in a given year - I use the
# abundance_age2plus to help inform the prior of the starting abundance (it will
# still be vague - see Priors and starting values section). Note that these
# values aren't very consistent because the MR age2plus abundance is actually
# exploitable not total abundance... some abd are from MR estimates, others are
# from an ASA model or the YPR/SPR model (lots of overturn in biometricians.  Currently I add this value manually
# to the .csv until I can figure out a slicker way to update it each year.
