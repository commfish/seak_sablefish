# Introduction

Sablefish have been commercially fished in Southeast Alaska inside waters since at least the early 1900s, with active management in the Northern Southeast Inside (NSEI) management area beginning in 1945 (Figure 2 in Carlile et al. 2002).
Early attempts to track fishery performance and estimate abundance of sablefish in NSEI included a vessel logbook program that began in 1932 and a tagging experiment in 1951 (Carlile et al. 2002).
A number of statistical catch-at-age models for NSEI sablefish have been developed; however, none of these models have been used to set annual harvest quotas (Carlile et al. 2002, Dressel 2009, Mueter 2010, Williams and Van Kirk 2017).

Currently the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) conducts an annual mark-recapture survey that serves as the basis for stock assessment and managment (Stahl and Holum 2010). 
Fish are tagged during a pot survey in May, with recaptures occurring in the ADF&G longline survey in July and the longline fishery in August (Beder and Stahl 2016). 
A time-stratified Chapmanized Petersen model is used to estimate abundance in a Bayesian framework using `JAGS 4.3.0` (Chapman 1951, Sullivan and Williams 2018, Depaoli 2016). 
Abundance estimates are partitioned into age classes in order to estimate biomass at age using age composition and weight-at-age data collected during the longline survey and fishery. 
ADF&G has defined Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) as $F_{ABC}$=$F_{50\%}$ for the NSEI sablefish stock (Dressel 2009). 
A yield-per-recruit model is used to estimate $F_{50\%}$ using the `optim()` function in the statistical software `R` (R Core Team 2018). 

Several factors motivated the development of a statistical catch-at-age model. 
The current ADF&G framework relies heavily on the mark-recapture experiment, which may be vulnerable to future budget cuts. 
Further the mark-recapture estimate provides a single snapshot in time and is susceptible to high inter-annual variability in abundance and biomass estimates.
Consequently, it is difficult to fully integrate all available data sources, explore historical trends, or fully assess stock status or harvest strategies. 
ADF&G collects a significant amount of data in the NSEI through multiple surveys, logbooks, and port sampling (Figure \@ref(fig:datsrc)). 
Moving to a new modeling framework will allow us to better utilize these data and will make management more resilient to potential budget cuts. 
Additionally, the current assessment relies on Federal estimates of selectivity and does not estimate recruitment for the stock. 
If there are differences in availability, gear selectivity, or stock dynamics between Federal waters and NSEI, we are unable to detect them.
Finally, strong recruitment from the 2014 and possibly 2013 and 2015 year classes were reported in the Federal assessment, prompting questions about how to treat uncertainty in recruitment for State management (Hanselman et al. 2017, Sullivan and Williams 2018). 
A statistical catch-at-age model coded in Template Model Builder (`TMB`) will allow more flexibility in exploring recruitment using random effects (Kristensen et al. 2016).

# Modeling approach	

The statistical catch-at-age model presented here was coded in `TMB`, an `R` library that leverages `C/C++` functionality to calculate first and second order derivatives and was inspired by a similar `C/C++` templating software `ADMB` (Kristensen et al. 2016, Fournier et al. 2012). 
The `TMB` code replicates or makes refinements to methods used in a previous attempt at modeling the NSEI sablefish stock (Mueter 2010); this model was based on `ADMB` code from an older Federal assessment of sablefish that has also been adapted for Alaska rockfish stocks (Kimura 1990, Sigler 1999). 
The model can be run as either a single-sex or sex-structured model; however, data inputs are only shown for the sex-structured option. 
Variable definitions for all equations used in the statistical catch-at-age model can be found in Table \@ref(tab:vardefns).

# Data inputs

The data used as inputs to the `TMB` model, including point estimates, variance, and sample sizes for composition data, can be found in `seak_sablefish/data/TMB_inputs`. 
A summary of the available data by year can be found in Figure \@ref(fig:datsrc).

## Weight-at-age

Data from the 2002-`r YEAR` longline fishery and 1997-`r YEAR` ADF&G longline surveys were used to obtain weight-at-age. 
We fit sex-specific three-parameter weight-based Ludwig von Bertalanffy growth models to weight-at-age data:

$$\ln(w_a)=\ln W_{\infty}+\beta \cdot \ln (1-\exp (a-t_0)) ,$$


where $w_a$ is weight at a given age (kg), $W_{\infty}$ is the mean asymptotic weight (kg), $\beta$ is the power in the allometric equation and relates to the rate at which $W_{\infty}$ is reached, and $t_0$ is the theoretical age at weight zero (years). 

The Federal assessment uses survey weight-at-age exclusively to fit to catch and effort indices (Hanselman et al. 2018). 
However, because discarding is permitted in the State fishery, there are large differences in survey and fishery weight-at-age, especially at younger ages (Figure \@ref(fig:bioinputs)A). 
Consequently fishery weight-at-age was fit to landed catch biomass, while survey weight-at-age was used to estimate exploitable biomass, spawning biomass, and other quantities of interest in the model (Figure \@ref(fig:bioinputs)A). 

## Maturity-at-age

Data from the 1997-`r YEAR` ADF&G longline surveys were used to fit a maturity curve for females and estimate spawning stock biomass within the model (Figure \@ref(fig:bioinputs)B). 
Alternative length, age, and year-specific models were evaluated using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike 1974). 
The length-based maturity curve fit to all years was the best-fitting model. 
We used a logistic regression approach in `R`, such that the probability $p$ of being mature at a given length on the logit scale is a linear function of length ($l$):

$$\ln(\frac{p_l}{1-p_l})=\beta_0+\beta_1 \cdot l.$$

Predicted maturity-at-length was transformed to maturity-at-age using fitted values from a length-based von Bertalanffy growth curve. 
The length at 50% maturity is 61 cm and the age at 50% maturity is 6.4 years. 
Predicted proportions mature-at-age were used as inputs to the assessment model and in the calculation of spawning stock biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:bioinputs)B).

## Sex ratios

A generalized additive model (GAM) was fit to sex ratio information from the 1997-`r YEAR` ADF&G longline surveys using the `gam()` function in the `mgcv` R package (Wood 2011). 
The probability of being female-at-age $r_a$ is modeled as a smooth function of age $a$

$$\ln(\frac{r_a}{1-r_a})=s(a).$$

Fits to the data suggest that female sablefish make up the majority of catch-at-age in the survey until roughly age-18 and then decline to <40% by age-30 (Figure \@ref(fig:bioinputs)C). 
Predicted values of proportion female-at-age were used to estimate spawning stock biomass in the single sex model. 
These data are not used in the sex-structured model.

## Catch

Catch data from 1980-`r YEAR` include harvest in the directed sablefish longline fishery, ADF&G longline survey removals, and sablefish retained in other fisheries like the IFQ halibut longline fishery (Figure \@ref(fig:abdind)A). 
Catch was assumed to be lognormally distributed, with a fixed log standard deviation of 0.05. 
 
Changes in the management structure during this period included a move to Limited Entry in 1985 and the Equal Quota Share (EQS) Program in 1994.
Additional sources of mortality that are not currently included in this model include sport, subsistence and personal use harvest, estimated bycatch mortality in the halibut fishery, and estimated deadloss, which includes mortality from sand fleas, sharks, and whales. 
Currently these additional sources of mortality are accounted for in the decrements process used to calculate the Annual Harvest Objective. 
Methods should be developed to incorporate these data into the model in the future.  

## Fishery CPUE

Fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in kg per hook was used as an index of abundance from  1980-`r YEAR` (Figure \@ref(fig:abdind)B). 
This index was assumed to be lognormally distributed, with a fixed log standard deviation of 0.1 for the historical data (1980-1996) and 0.08 for the contemporary data (1997 to present). 
Separate catchabilities and selectivity curves were assumed for pre-EQS and EQS time periods (Table \@ref(tab:fedsel)).

## Survey CPUE

Longline survey CPUE in numbers per hook was used as an index of abundance from 1997-`r YEAR` (Figure \@ref(fig:abdind)C). 
This index was assumed to be lognormally distributed, with a fixed log standard deviation of 0.1. 
An earlier ADF&G longline survey in 1988-1996 used a shorter soak time of 1-hr instead of the current 3-11 hr (Carlile et al. 2002). 
These data were omitted because the 1-hr soak time was likely too short to provide an accurate measure of relative abundance (Sigler 1993).

## Mark-recapture abundance

The mark-recapture abundance index was included for 2003-2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, and `r YEAR` (Figure \@ref(fig:abdind)D). 
A time-stratified Petersen mark-recapture model implemented in `JAGS 4.3.0` was used to estimate abundance (Sullivan and Williams 2018, Depaoli 2016). 
Further information about how these indices were derived can be found in Sullivan and Williams (2018). 
This index was assumed to be lognormally distributed, and the log standard deviation was approximated as the coefficient of variation from the posterior distribution of the mark-recapture abundance estimates. 

## Age compositions

Fishery age compositions from the 2002-`r YEAR` longline fishery and survey age compositions from the 1997-`r YEAR` ADF&G longline surveys were included in the model (Figure \@ref(fig:agecomps)). 
Sample sizes were deemed insufficient to fit age compositions by sex, so age data have been aggregated for both the survey and fishery. 
Age compositions were assumed to follow the multinomial or Dirichlet-multinomial distributions (only results for the multinomial are shown in this report). 
Until more sophisticated tuning methods or estimates of effective sample size can be developed for NSEI, effective sample sizes were calculated as the square root of the total sample size in a given year.

An ageing error matrix for NSEI is currently being developed in conjunction with the ADF&G Age Determination Unit.
Until this has been fully developed and reviewed, the Federal sablefish ageing error matrix has been made available to the State (D. Hanselman, 	Fisheries Research Biologist, NOAA, Juneau, personal communication April 2019; Hanselman et al. 2018; Heifetz et al. 1999; Figure \@ref(fig:ageerror)).
The ageing error matrix ($\Omega_{a',a}$) is the proportion observed at age $a$ given the true age $a'$.
Ageing error matrices are critical for correcting observed age compositions and estimating recruitment (Fournier and Archibald 1982). 

## Length compositions

Length data from the 2002-`r YEAR` longline fishery and 1997-`r YEAR` ADF&G longline surveys were summarized using the Federal conventions for length compositions (Hanselman et al. 2018). 
The Federal assessment uses 2-cm length bins ranging from 41-99 cm. 
Fish less than 41 cm ($l_0$) were omitted from the analysis, and fish greater than 99 cm were aggregated into the 99 cm length bin ($l_{+}$). 
Sample sizes were adequate to separate length compositions by sex.

Length distributions in fishery (Figure \@ref(fig:fshlen)) show dramatically different patterns than the survey (Figure \@ref(fig:srvlen)), with the fishery length distribution truncated at approximately 60 cm. 
Full retention is not a requirement in State waters and the length differences between the survey and fishery are attributed to discarding of small fish in the fishery. 
Because of the bias introduced by allowing fish to be released in the fishery, there is a question of whether fishery age and length compositions should be included in model. 

Finally, the selective harvest of larger-bodied individuals results in large differences between survey and fishery size-at-age. 
Until an age-length key is developed for NSEI, the Federal age-length keys ($\Lambda_{a,l,k}$) will be used to fit both survey and fishery length compositions (D. Hanselman, Fisheries Research Biologist, NOAA, Juneau, personal communication April 2019; Hanselman et al. 2018; Echave et al. 2012; Figure \@ref(fig:agelenkey)). Ultimately, separate age-length keys should be developed for each data source to account for the differences in survey and fishery size-at-age.

## Retention probability 

To model the discarding behavior in the NSEI fishery, processor grade and price per pound data were used to inform retention probabilities at size (Figure \@ref(fig:retention)).
Based on conversations with ADF&G port sampling staff and fishermen, the lower bound of the Grade 2/3 (1.4 kg) was assigned a 10% retention probability, the lower bound of the Grade 3/4 (2.2 kg) was assigned a 50% retention probability, and everything greater than 6.4 kg was assigned a 100% retention probability (A. Olson, Groundfish Project Leader, ADF&G July 2018). 
Remaining retention probabilities were interpolated between these fixed values. Weight-based retention probabilities were translated to sex and age $R_{a,k}$ using sex- and weight-based von Bertalanffy growth curves (Figure \@ref(fig:retention)).

# Model parameters

## Natural mortality

Natural mortality $M$ was assumed constant over time and age and fixed at 0.10, which is consistent with past State and Federal assessments (Johnson and Quinn 1988, Hanselman et al. 2018). 

## Discard mortality

Stachura et al. (2012) estimated discard mortality $D$ of sablefish to be 11.7% using release-recapture data from a longline survey in Southeast Alaska. 
It is likely that discard mortality in a fishery is higher due to careful fish handling on survey vessels during tagging experiments. 
Therefore the discard mortality rate from the Pacific halibut fishery, $D$=16%, was used (Gilroy and Stewart 2013). 
The halibut fishery is assumed a reasonable proxy for sablefish, because the fisheries utilize similar gear and frequently the same vessels and crew participate in both fisheries.
Moreover, both species are considered hardy, do not experience barotrauma, and are known to survive well in laboratory experiments.

## Selectivity

The longline fishery and survey are assumed to follow a logistic selectivity pattern. 
Currently two parameterizations of logistic selectivity are available in the `TMB` model.

The first parameterization uses $s_{50}$ and $s_{95}$, which represent the ages at which 50% and 95% of individuals are selected by the gear.
Selectivity-at-age ($s_a$) for this parameterization is defined as

$$s_a=\frac{1}{1+\mbox{exp}\frac{-\mbox{ln}(19)(a-s_{50})}{s_{95}-s_{50}}}.$$

The second parameterization uses $s_{50}$ and $\delta$, which represent the ages at which 50% of individuals are selected by the gear and the shape or slope of the logistic curve, respectively. 
Selectivity-at-age ($s_a$) for this parameterization is defined as

$$s_a=\frac{1}{1+\mbox{exp}(-k(a-s_{50}))}.$$

Selectivity is fit separately for the longline fishery ($fsh$) and survey ($srv$). 
There is flexibility to define discrete time blocks for both fishery and survey selectivity. 

Currently fishery and survey selectivity are fixed in the model using Federal selectivity values for the derby (pre-EQS), contemporary fishery (EQS), and longline survey (Hanselman et al. 2018, Figure \@ref(fig:fixedsel), Table \@ref(tab:fedsel)). 

Estimating selectivity will be challenging when accounting for fishery discards because no age or length data are available on the discarded population. 
One potential solution is to estimate a single selectivity for the longline survey and then apply that selectivity curve to the fishery.
Further information is needed to better characterize how discarding behavior has changed over time and if discarding was common pre-EQS.

## Catchability

Currently four parameters for catchability are estimated: two for fishery catchability (pre-EQS and EQS) $\text{ln}(q_{fsh})$, one for the ADF&G longline survey $\text{ln}(q_{srv})$, and one for the mark-recapture abundance index $\text{ln}(q_{MR})$.

## Recruitment and initial numbers-at-age

The numbers-at-age matrix $N$ is parameterized with mean log-recruitment $\mu_R$, `r nyr` ($T$) log-recruitment deviations $\tau$, mean log initial numbers-at-age $\mu_N$, and `r nage-2` ($A-2$) deviations from mean log initial numbers-at-age $\psi$.

Following the Federal assessment, if recruitment is estimated using penalized likelihood, the parameter that describes the variability of $\tau$ and $\psi$, $\text{ln}(\sigma_R)$, is fixed at 0.1823 (Sigler et al. 2002, Hanselman et al. 2018). 
However, if $\tau$ and $\psi$ are estimated as random effects, $\text{ln}(\sigma_R)$ is an estimated parameter. Results are only shown for the penalized likelihood approach.

## Fishing mortality

There is one parameter estimated for mean log-fishing mortality, $\mu_F$, and `r nyr` ($T$) log-fishing mortality deviations $\phi$.

# Population dynamics

The population dynamics of this model are governed by the following state dynamics equations, where the number of sablefish $N$ in year $t=1$, age $a$, and sex $k$ are defined as

$$N_{1,a,k} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
0.5\cdot\mbox{exp}(\mu_R-M(a-a_0)+\psi_a) &a_{0}<a<a_{+}\\
0.5\cdot\mbox{exp}(\mu_R-M(a_{+}-1))/(1-\mbox{exp}(-M)) &a=a_{+}
\end{array}\right.$$
Recruitment to age-2 in all years and the remaining projected $N$ matrix is defined as

$$N_{t,a,k} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
0.5\cdot\mbox{exp}(\mu_R+\tau_t) &a=a_0\\
0.5\cdot N_{t-1,a-1,k}\mbox{exp}(Z_{t-1,a-1,k}) &a_{0}<a<a_{+}\\
0.5\cdot N_{t-1,a-1,k}\mbox{exp}(Z_{t-1,a-1,k})+N_{t-1,a,k}\mbox{exp}(Z_{t-1,a,k}) &a=a_{+}
\end{array}\right.$$

where the total instantaneous mortality, $Z_{t,a,k}$, is the sum of natural mortality $M$ and fishing mortality $F_{t,a,k}$. 

Total annual fishing mortality $F_t$ is defined as

$$F_t=\mbox{exp}(\mu_F+\phi_t).$$

Fishing mortality is modeled as a function of fishery selectivity $s_{t,a,k}$, retention probability $R_{a,k}$ (the age-specific probability of being landed given being caught, Figure \@ref(fig:retention)), and discard mortality $D$:

$$F_{t,a,k}=s_{t,a,k}^{fsh}(R_{a,k}+D(1-R_{a,k}))F_t.$$

# Predicted values

Predicted fishery CPUE (kg per hook) in year $t$ $\hat{I_t}^{fsh}$ was defined as a function of fishery catchability $q_{fsh}$ and biomass available to the fishery:

$$\hat{I_t}^{fsh}=q_{fsh}\sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{a=a_0}^{a+}w_{a,k}^{srv} \cdot s_{t,a,k}^{fsh} \cdot N_{t,a,k} \cdot S^{fsh},$$

where $w_{a,k}^{srv}$ is mean weight-at-age by sex in the longline survey and $S^{srv}$ is the fraction of individuals in year $t$ surviving to the beginning of the fishery in August. 
Survival equations include natural and fishing mortality because the model assumes continuous fishing mortality.

Predicted longline survey CPUE (numbers per hook) in year $t$ ($\hat{I_t}^{srv}$) was defined as a function survey catchability $q^{srv}$, abundance available to the survey, and survival to the beginning of the survey in July ($S^{srv}$):

$$\hat{I_t}^{srv}=q_{srv}\sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{a=a_0}^{a+}s_{t,a,k}^{srv} \cdot N_{t,a,k} \cdot S^{srv}.$$

Predicted mark-recapture abundance in year $t$ ($\hat{I_t}^{MR}$) was defined as a function of mark-recapture catchability $q^{MR}$, abundance available to the fishery, and survival to the beginning of the NSEI fishery in August ($S^{fsh}$):

$$\hat{I_t}^{MR}=q_{MR}\sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{a=a_0}^{a+}s_{t,a,k}^{fsh} \cdot N_{t,a,k} \cdot S^{fsh}.$$

Spawning biomass $SSB$ was calculated as

$$SSB=\sum_{a=a_0}^{a+} w_{a,f}^{srv} \cdot N_{t,a,f} \cdot S^{spawn} \cdot p_a,$$

where $w_{a,f}^{srv}$ is mean weight-at-age of females in the longline survey, $S^{spawn}$ is the fraction of individuals surviving to spawn in February, and $p_a$ is the proportion of females mature in the survey at age. 
In the single sex model, proportion of females at age in the survey $r_a$ is used to get the female portion of the $N$ matrix. 

Predicted survey age compositions (sexes combined) were computed as

$$\hat{P}_{t,a}^{srv}=\Omega_{a',a}\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{2}N_{t,a,k} \cdot s_{a,k}^{srv}}{\sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{a=a_0}^{a+} N_{t,a,k} \cdot s_{a,k}^{srv}},$$

where $\Omega_{a',a}$ is the ageing error matrix. 
Predicted fishery age compositions (sexes combined) were computed as

$$\hat{P}_{t,a}^{fsh}=\Omega_{a',a}\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{2}C_{t,a,k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{a=a_0}^{a+} C_{t,a,k}},$$

where $C_{t,a,k}$ is the landed catch in numbers-at-age by sex derived from a modified Baranov catch equation:

$$C_{t,a,k}=N_{t,a,k}\frac{R_{a,k}F_{t,a,k}}{Z_{t,a,k}}(1-\mbox{exp}(-Z_{t,a,k})),$$

where $R_{a,k}$ is the assumed probability of retention by age and sex (Figure \@ref(fig:retention)).

Predicted landed catch in biomass $\hat{Y}$ was calculated as the product of fishery weight-at-age $w_{a,k}^{fsh}$ and landed catch in numbers-at-age:

$$\hat{Y}_t=\sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{a=a_0}^{a+} w_{a,k}^{fsh} \cdot C_{t,a,k}.$$

The biomass of discarded sablefish estimated to die ($W_t$) with an assumed discard mortality ($D$) of 0.16 is

$$W_t= \sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{a=a_0}^{a+}w_{a,k}^{srv}N_{t,a,k}\frac{D (1-R_{a,k})F_{t,a,k}}{Z_{t,a,k}}(1-\mbox{exp}(-Z_{t,a,k})).$$

Predicted survey length compositions were calculated using the sex-specific age-length keys ($\Lambda_{a,l,k}$), such that

$$\hat{P}_{t,l,k}^{srv}=\Lambda_{a,l,k}\frac{N_{t,a,k} \cdot s_{a,k}^{srv}}{\sum_{a=a_0}^{a+} N_{t,a,k} \cdot s_{a,k}^{srv}}.$$

Fishery length compositions were calculated as 

$$\hat{P}_{t,l,k}^{fsh}=\Lambda{a,l,k}\frac{C_{t,a,k}}{\sum_{a=a_0}^{a+} C_{t,a,k}}.$$

# Likelihood components

The objective function, or the total negative log-likelihood to be minimized, included the sum of the following likelihood components $L$, which received individual weights $\lambda$:

1.  Landed catch biomass ($Y$) was modeled using a lognormal likelihood where $\sigma_Y$ was assumed to be 0.05: 

$$\mbox{ln}L(Y)=\lambda_Y\frac{1}{2\sigma_Y^2}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\Big(\mbox{ln}(Y_t+c)-\mbox{ln}(\hat{Y}_t+c)\Big)^2 ,$$
where $\lambda_Y$ = 1.0 and $c$ is a small constant set at 0.0001 to allow approximately zero catches in log-space.  

2.  Fishery CPUE, survey CPUE, and the mark-recapture abundance index were modeled using lognormal likelihoods, where $\sigma_I$ was assumed to be 0.08 for the fishery and survey CPUEs and annual posterior standard deviations were used for the mark-recapture abundance index: 

$$\mbox{ln}L(I)=\lambda_I\frac{1}{2\sigma_I^2}\sum_{t=1}^{T_I}\Big(\mbox{ln}(I_t+c)-\mbox{ln}(\hat{I}_t+c)\Big)^2 ,$$

where $T_I$ is the number of years of data for each index and $\lambda_I$ is set to 1.0.

3.  Fishery and survey age compositions were modeled using the multinomial likelihood ($P^{age}$), where effective sample size $\omega_t$ was calculated as the square root of the total sample size in year $t$: 

$$\mbox{ln}L(P^{age})=\lambda_{P^{age}}\sum_{t=1}^{T_P^{age}} - \omega_t \sum_{a=a_0}^{a+} (P_{t,a}+c)\cdot\mbox{ln}(\hat{P}_{t,a}+c),$$

where $T_P^{age}$ is the number of years of data for each age composition, $\lambda_{P^{age}}$ is set to 1.0, and $c$ prevents the composition from being 0 in the likelihood calculation. 
Standard methods of tuning the effective sample size or iterative re-weighting have not yet been applied to this assessment model (McAllister and Ianelli 1997, Francis 2011). 
Alternatively, effective sample size can be calculated through the estimation of an additional parameter $\theta$ using the Dirichlet-multinomial likelihood (Thorson et al. 2017): 
$$\mbox{ln}L(P^{age})=\sum_{t=1}^{T_P^{age}} -\Gamma(n_t+1)-\sum_{a=a_0}^{a+}\Gamma(n_t P_{t,a}+1)+\Gamma(n_t\theta)-\Gamma(n_t+\theta n_t)+\sum_{a=a_0}^{a+}\Big[\Gamma(n_tP_{t,a}+\theta n_t \hat{P}_{t,a})-\Gamma(\theta n_t \hat{P}_{t,a})\Big]$$,


where $n$ is the input sample size. The relationship between $n$, $\theta$, and $\omega$ is 

$$\omega_t = \frac{1+\theta n_t}{1+\theta}.$$

Because the implementation of the alternative Dirichlet-multinomial likelihood is currently under development, only results for the multinomial likelihood are presented here.

4.  Fishery and survey length compositions by sex were modeled using the multinomial likelihood ($P^{len}$), where effective sample size $\omega_t$ was calculated as the square root of the total sample size in year $t$: 

$$\mbox{ln}L(P^{len})=\lambda_{P^{len}}\sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{t=1}^{T_P^{len}} - \omega_t \sum_{l=l_0}^{l+} (P_{t,l}+c)\cdot\mbox{ln}(\hat{P}_{t,l}+c).$$

$T_P^{len}$ is the number of years of data for each length composition and $\lambda_{Plen}$ is set to 1.0.

5.  Annual log-fishing mortality deviations ($\phi_t$) are included with a penalized lognormal likelihood, where 

$$\mbox{ln}L(\phi)=\lambda_{\phi}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\phi_t^2,$$
where $\lambda_{\phi}$=0.1.

6.  Recruitment deviations ($\tau_t$) can be included using a penalized lognormal likelihood 

$$\mbox{ln}L(\tau)=\lambda_{\tau}\sum_{i=1}^{T+A-2}(\tau_i-0.5\sigma_R^2)^2,$$

where $-0.5\sigma^2$ is a bias correction needed to obtain the expected value (mean) instead of the median. 
The $\lambda_{\phi}$=2.0 and $\sigma_R$ is fixed at 1.2 as in the Federal assessment (Hanselman et al. 2018). 
Alternatively, recruitment deviations can be estimated as a random effect, where 

$$\mbox{ln}L(\tau)=\sum_{i=1}^{T+A-2}\mbox{ln}(\sigma_R)+\frac{(\tau_i-0.5\sigma_R^2)^2}{2\sigma_R}.$$

Initial numbers-at-age deviations $\psi_a$ are implemented in the same way as recruitment deviations and are governed by the same $\sigma_R$. 
Only results for the penalized likelihood approach are shown.

7.  Because the mark-recapture abundance index scales the exploitable population, a normal prior is imposed on $q_{MR}$ of 1.0 with a standard deviation of 0.1. 
Vague priors are assigned to fishery and survey $q$.
Future work on this model should include the development of priors for fishery and survey $q$.

# Preliminary results and discussion

A summary of parameter estimates and standard errors are reported in Table \@ref(tab:keyparams). The objective function value (negative log likelihood) was 1,007.1. 
The maximum gradient component was 0.00086, barely passing the minimum convergence criteria of 0.001.
A summary of the contributions of each likelihood component to the total objective function can be found in Table \@ref(tab:likesum). 

In particular, mean recruitment and deviations were difficult to estimate (Table \@ref(tab:keyparams)).  
Initially, the weight on this likelihood component was assumed to be low ($\lambda_{\tau}=0.1$), but this yielded an improbably large spike (>40 times the mean value) in age-2 recruitment in 2016 corresponding to the 2014 year class. 
Increasing the $\lambda_{\tau}$ to 2.0 resulted in more reasonable parameter estimates and decreased the age-2 recruitment to ~8 times mean recruitment. 
Alternatively, it may be that the parameter governing variability in recruitment $\sigma_R$ should be reduced or estimated using random effects. 
Currently $\sigma_R$ is fixed to 1.2; however, it is possible $\sigma_R$ is too high for a low productivity species like sablefish (Sigler et al. 2002, Hanselman et al. 2018). 
Future work should include an analysis to evaluate assumptions about $\sigma_R$. 

Preliminary fits to catch and indices of abundance are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:predabdind). 
Results suggest that the model fits catch, pre-EQS fishery CPUE, and mark-recapture abundance reasonably well in most years. 
Contemporary fishery CPUE (EQS) does not fit well, with long runs of positive or negative residuals (Figure \@ref(fig:residabdind)). 
The model performs poorly during the period directly following the implementation of EQS in 1994 for all indices, including catch (Figure \@ref(fig:residabdind)). 
Prior to implementing this model for management, further consideration should be given to which abundance indices should be used in the model. 
For example, because discarding is legal in NSEI and past logbook data have not required released fish to be recorded, fishery CPUE may not be a suitable index of abundance. 
Starting in 2019, fishermen will be required to provide an estimate of number of released sablefish by set; however, there will still be no record of length or weight of these discards.
Finally, variability in catch, survey, and fishery CPUE indices was assumed (Figure \@ref(fig:abdind)). 
Future enhancements could include estimating this variability using available data.

Preliminary fits to fishery and age compositions are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:fshage) and \@ref(fig:srvage), respectively. 
Although the model fits the general shape of the age compositions in most years, there are poor residual patterns (Figure \@ref(fig:residage)). 
Fits to male and female fishery length compositions are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:malefshlen) and \@ref(fig:femalefshlen), respectively. Fits to male and female survey length compositions are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:malesrvlen) and \@ref(fig:femalesrvlen), respectively. 
Similar to the age compositions, the model predicts the general shape of the length compositions in for both the survey and fishery in most years.
Despite this, there are also poor residual patterns in the length compositions (Figure \@ref(fig:residlen)).

There are several caveats to the preliminary fits to composition data. 
First, no efforts have been made to externally estimate, tune, or iteratively re-weight the input effective samples sizes for the composition data (McAllister and Ianelli 1997, Francis 2011). 
This exercise should be completed prior to implementation of this model. 
Second, results presented here assume fixed selectivity equal to the Federal fishery. 
Because no data on discards exist, it may not be possible to estimate fishery selectivity while fitting to the composition data. 
Stock assessments that account for discarded catch frequently have observer data and will overcome this challenge through the estimation of a separate selectivity for discarded catch.
An alternative approach is to estimate survey selectivity and then assume fishery and survey selectivity are equal.
Finally, fishery size-at-age is larger than survey size-at-age, especially at younger ages. 
Consequently, fits to fishery length compositions may benefit from the development of separate age-length keys for the NSEI survey and fishery.

Derived indices of age-2 recruitment, female spawning stock biomass, and exploitable abundance and biomass (i.e. available to the fishery) suggest that this stock has been in a period of low productivity since the mid-1990s (Figure \@ref(fig:derivedts)).
Recruitment trends are comparable with Federal values, and estimates of spawning stock biomass, exploitable biomass, and exploitable abundance are in par with past and current ADF&G estimates (Hanselman et al 2018, Sullivan and Williams 2018).
A time series of fishing mortality and harvest rate (defined as the ratio of predicted total catch to exploitable biomass) shows that peak exploitation occurred in the decade following the transition to EQS, 1995-2005 (Figure \@ref(fig:fishmort)). 
The model suggests that harvest rates were more than four times what they are today during this time period.

Although not currently ready to be considered for management, the statistical catch-at-age model outlined here is planned to be presented as a management alternative in 2020. 
Planned future developments to this model are summarized by priority level in the following sections. 

## High priority

The following tasks must be completed in order for this model to be considered for management:

- Complete the development and estimation of management reference points.
- Develop rationale for the choice of fishery-dependent data sources to include in the model and whether fishery selectivity should be fixed or estimated. This relates to the challenge of accounting for unobserved discards while estimating fishery selectivity and fitting to landed catch compositions. 
- Improve weighting methods and tune model to composition data.

## Short-term

These tasks should be completed within 1-2 years of implementation. They are critical components of a well-developed statistical catch-at-age model. 

- Implement Bayesian analysis to evaluate posterior densities of estimated and derived quantities of interest.
- Evaluate estimation and assumptions about recruitment variability.
- Conduct retrospective analysis to determine model performance over time.
- Develop framework to conduct projections to evaluate stock status and assess risk.

## Long-term

These tasks should be completed within 2-4 years of implementation. While they are not critical to the implementation of the model, they will improve model-based inference, understanding of stock dynamics, and data quality.

- Develop ageing error matrices and age-length keys for NSEI.
- Review indices of abundance. In particular the fishery and survey CPUE have little contrast and may not be useful indices of abundance. This may include standardizing CPUE through generalized linear or addition modeling to account for variables to affect CPUE. It may also include developing algorithms to identify trip and set targets and allocating total trip landings to set effort.
- Evaluate alternative harvest policies and biological reference points.
- Improve methods for accounting for fishery discards, including conducting research to better understand discarding behavior and how it has changed over time. 
- Develop priors for catchability and other relevant parameters. 
- Assess alternative sources of data, especially historical biological and catch data (Carlile et al. 2002).
- Develop methods to account for additional sources of mortality, including sport, subsistence and personal use harvest, estimated bycatch mortality in the halibut fishery, and estimated deadloss, which includes mortality from sand fleas, sharks, and whales.
