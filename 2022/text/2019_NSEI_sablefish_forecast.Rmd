#Summary 

- The commercial catch in Chatham Strait in `r YEAR` was `r formatC(catch %>% filter(year == YEAR) %>% pull(total_pounds), format="d", big.mark=",")` round lb (`r fig('catch', display = "cite")`).

- The `r YEAR+1` recommended Allowable Biological Catch ($ABC$) for Northern Southeast Inside Waters (NSEI - Chatham Strait) at a fully-selected fishing mortality of $F_{50\%}$ = `r ABC` round lb (`r tbl('full_summary', display = "cite")`, `r fig('ABC_ts', display = "cite")`). This is a `r diff` lb increase (`r perc_change`%) from the `r YEAR` $ABC$ of `r ABC_ly` round lb.

- The population estimate from the `r YEAR` mark-recapture study in Chatham Strait is `r abd_YEAR_upd` individuals (`r tbl('full_summary', display = "cite")`, `r fig('retro', display="cite")`). This is `r eval_abd` forecasted `r YEAR-1` mark-recapture estimate of `r abd_YEAR_ly` sablefish for `r YEAR`. The forecast abundance for `r YEAR+1` is `r abd_FOREC` individuals (`r tbl('full_summary', display = "cite")`, `r fig('retro', display="cite")`). Note that the forecasted abundance will always be lower than the current year's estimate of abundance under the current management model.

- Despite the large increase in abundance, fish younger than 7 years comprise approximately 20% of the forecasted abundance for `r YEAR+1`, and less than 50% of females are estimated to be mature at this age (`r fig('forec_Natage', display="cite")`). Using a discard mortality of 16%, the estimated mortality from discarding small fish is `r discards` round lb. We recommend that this discard mortality is accounted for in the calculation of the Annual Harvest Objective ($AHO$). The methods used to estimate discard mortality are described in Sections I and IV of this document.

- Female sablefish continue to be retained in greater proportion in the commercial fishery. The proportion of females observed in the commercial catch is greater than the proportion of females in the longline survey for all ages (`r fig('propfem', display="cite")`).

- Catch per unit effort (CPUE) in the `r YEAR` ADF&G Chatham Strait longline survey `r srv_ly$eval_ly` relative to `r YEAR-1` from `r formatC(srv_ly$lastyr, format="f", digits=2)` to `r formatC(srv_ly$thisyr, format="f", digits=2)` numbers per hook (`r formatC(abs(srv_ly$perc_change_ly), format="f", digits=1)`%) (`r fig('srv_cpue', display = "cite")`). This reflects a `r formatC(abs(srv_lt$perc_change_lt), format="f", digits=1)`% `r srv_lt$eval_lt` from the ten year average CPUE of `r formatC(srv_lt$lt_mean, format="f", digits=2)` sablefish per hook. Survey CPUE has been stable since 1997 and has not consistently tracked trends in abundance estimated from mark-recapture studies (`r fig('retro', display="cite")`).

```{r fishery_cpue, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Percent change in compared to a ten year rolling average
fsh_sum %>% 
  filter(year > YEAR - 10 & year <= YEAR) %>% 
  mutate(lt_mean = mean(cpue),
         perc_change_lt = (cpue - lt_mean) / lt_mean * 100,
         eval_lt = ifelse(perc_change_lt < 0, "decrease", "increase")) %>% 
  filter(year == YEAR) -> fsh_lt

# Percent change from last year

  mutate(perc_change_ly = (thisyr - lastyr) / lastyr * 100,
         eval_ly = ifelse(perc_change_ly < 0, "decreased", "increased")) -> fsh_ly
```

- Commercial longline fishery CPUE  `r fsh_ly$eval_ly` relative to `r YEAR-1` from `r formatC(fsh_ly$lastyr, format="f", digits=2)` to `r formatC(fsh_ly$thisyr, format="f", digits=2)` lb per hook (`r formatC(abs(fsh_ly$perc_change_ly), format="f", digits=1)`%) (`r fig('fsh_cpue', display = "cite")`). Fishery CPUE in `r YEAR` was a `r formatC(abs(fsh_lt$perc_change_lt), format="f", digits=1)`% `r fsh_lt$eval_lt` from the ten-year average CPUE of `r formatC(fsh_lt$lt_mean, format="f", digits=2)` lb per hook. This increase could be attributed to the large influx of fish recruiting to the fishery from the 2014 year class.

- The 2013 and 2014 year classes were well-represented in the ADF&G longline survey age composition (`r fig('srv_agecomps', display = "cite")`). The 2014 year class was first observed in the 2016 commercial fishery age-composition data as age-2 fish (`r fig('fsh_agecomps', display = "cite")`).

- The NSEI sablefish assessment was developed as a reproducible research product (de Leeuw 2001). It is hosted publicly on the web-based version control service GitHub at https://github.com/commfish/seak_sablefish. This product is considered conditionally reproducible, meaning that potential users must formally request any confidential data sourced in the code to produce the full assessment (Schwab et al. 2000). However, survey and other non-confidential data are made available, and all queries and subsequent transformations to the data are included in the analysis. 

# Section I: Changes to the NSEI sablefish assessment for `r YEAR+1` relative to `r YEAR`

1.  Fishermen in State waters are allowed to discard small, unmarketable fish as long as they are healthy (i.e not dead, sand flea bitten, etc.). Due to the high volume of small fish encountered in the `r YEAR-1` and `r YEAR` fisheries, discard mortality was incorporated directly into last year's population dynamics model (Sullivan et al. 2018). These methods were refined in `r YEAR+1` using equations commonly applied in size-structured models to king and tanner crab stocks in Alaska (e.g. Zheng and Siddeek 2018). Because data on discards is not collected, the probability of a fish being retained was informed by processor grade definitions and prices and modeled as a function of weight, sex, and age (`r fig('discard_mort', display = "cite")`). Based on conversations with ADF&G port sampling staff and fishermen, the lower bound of the Grade 2/3 (1.4 kg) was assigned a 10% retention probability, the lower bound of the Grade 3/4 (2.2 kg) was assigned a 50% retention probability, and everything greater than 6.4 kg was assigned a 100% retention probability (`r fig('discard_mort', display = "cite")`, A. Olson, Groundfish Project Leader, ADF&G July 2018). Remaining retention probabilities were interpolated between these fixed values. This method of accounting for discards shifts fishing mortality toward older ages, especially for males that are slower growing than females (`r fig('F_discards', display = "cite")`). Stachura et al. (2012) estimated discard mortality of sablefish to be 11.7% using release-recapture data from a longline survey in Southeast Alaska. However, it is likely that discard mortality in a fishery is higher due to careful fish handling on survey vessels during tagging experiments. We therefore used 16%, the discard mortality rate from the Pacific halibut fishery (Gilroy and Stewart 2013). The halibut fishery is assumed a good proxy for sablefish, because the fisheries utilize similar gear and frequently the same vessels and crew participate in both fisheries. Moreover, both species are considered hardy, do not experience barotrauma, and are known to survive well in laboratory experiments.

2.  In `r YEAR` the abundance estimate of exploited abundance used to determine the $ABC$ was adjusted to account for uncertainty in recent recruitment events. Estimates of a single recruitment event can decrease significantly as the year class is observed over multiple years of age compositions, and the 2014 year class is now estimated to be 30% less than it was last year (Hanselman et al. 2017, Figure 3.57, Hanselman et al. 2018). In `r YEAR`, the adjustment was made by using the 15th percentile from the posterior distribution of the mark-recapture abundance estimate instead of the mean as the input to the forecast model (Sullivan et al. 2018). This adjustment was a subjective, precautionary measure aimed at stabilizing the fishery by slowing the rate of increase in harvest and reducing the risk of overfishing if the 2013 and 2014 year classes are estimated to be smaller as subsequent years of data are added (i.e. negative retrospective bias). 

We do not recommend using the 15th percentile method again in `r YEAR+1`. Instead, we recommend that conservation measures are made through the management framework by accounting for discards of small fish in the fishery. Mortality from discarding small fish is estimated to be `r discards` round lb in the `r YEAR+1` fishery, and we recommend this be deducted from the $ABC$ in the calculation of the $AHO$ (`r tbl('full_summary', display = "cite")`). In addition, we recommend continued work on an integrated age-structured model, so that methods for incoporating uncertainty into the estimation of management reference points can be improved in future assessments.

3.   In `r YEAR` and in past assessments, fishery weight-at-age was used to calculate exploited biomass and $ABC$. In `r YEAR+1`, longline survey weight-at-age predicted from a weight-based Ludwig von Bertalanffy growth model was used for all calculations. Longline survey weight-at-age provides a more accurate portrayal of size-at-age of the exploitable population, because it includes smaller fish that would be discarded in the fishery (`r fig('bio_inputs', display = "cite")`). The fishery opens directly following the end of the longline survey, as such, it is unlikely a seasonal effect could account for the differences in fishery and survey weight-at-age. 

4.  In past assessments the plus group (age 42+) weight-at-age was calculated as the empirical mean weight from all samples aged 42 and older. Because this estimate was influenced by outliers, we now use the predicted value for age-42 fish from the weight-based von Bertalanffy growth model used to estimate weight-at-age for all other ages. Weight-at-age and maturity estimates used in the yield-per-recruit model, estimate of biomass, and $ABC$ calculations are presented in `r fig('bio_inputs', display = "cite")`.

5.  A preliminary age-structured model is presented as an Appendix to this report. Once reviewed by managers and stakeholders, it will be presented as an alternative to the current management model.

# Section II: `r YEAR` Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC)

```{r tagsummary, include=FALSE}

read_csv(paste0("output/tag_summary_report_", YEAR, ".csv")) -> tag_sum

tagged <- tag_sum %>% 
  filter(Year == YEAR) %>% 
  pull(`$K$`)

tags_removed <- tagged - tag_sum %>% 
  filter(Year == YEAR) %>% 
  pull(`$K_0$`)

tag_sum[c(2:10)] <- lapply(tag_sum[,c(2:10)], prettyNum, trim=TRUE, big.mark=",")

```

The `r YEAR` marking survey released `r formatC(tagged, format="d", big.mark=",")` tagged fish. We accounted for tags recovered outside of the NSEI or period of recapture, natural and fishing mortality, and differences in the size of fish captured in the pot survey and the longline fishery (Section III). Alternative candidate models that accounted for movement in and out of Chatham Strait and incorporated fishery CPUE were explored.

The `r YEAR` abundance estimate of `r abd_YEAR_upd` was partitioned into sex-specific age classes using the `r YEAR` commercial fishery age compositions and projected into `r YEAR+1` (Section IV). This produced an estimated forecast of exploited abundance of `r abd_FOREC` individuals for `r YEAR+1`. Multiplying by longline survey weight-at-age produced a forecast of exploited biomass of `r summary_tbl[4,3]` round lb (`r tbl('full_summary', display = "cite")`). Mean weight-at-age was predicted from a weight-based Ludwig von Bertalanffy growth model fit to survey weight and age data from 1997 to `r YEAR` (`r fig('bio_inputs', display = "cite")`). 

The fishing mortality used to calculate the $ABC$ ($F_{ABC}$) was obtained from a yield-per-recruit analysis and fixed to $F_{ABC}=F_{50\%}$, where $F_{50\%}$ corresponds to the $F$ that would reduce the spawning biomass to 50% of the unfished levels. Biological inputs to the yield-per-recruit model included longline survey weight-at-age and estimated maturity from the longline survey (`r fig('bio_inputs', display = "cite")`). An $ABC$ of `r ABC` round lb was calculated as the landed portion of the total catch under $F_{50\%}$. The discarded portion of the catch that is assumed to die given a 16% discard mortality rate was calculated as `r discards` round lb (Section IV, `r tbl('full_summary', display = "cite")`). 

```{r fed_summary, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Federal assessment values - manual inputs
fed <- data.frame(ABC_thisyr = 15068, # YEAR + 1 final ABC (whale corrected)
                  ABC_lastyr = 14957) %>%  # YEAR final ABC
  mutate(perc_change = (ABC_thisyr - ABC_lastyr) / ABC_lastyr * 100,
         eval = ifelse(perc_change < 0, "decrease", "increase")) 
```

Unlike last year, the resultant changes in $ABC$ from `r YEAR-1` to `r YEAR` are different between NOAA and ADF&G. Although the Federal stock assessment for sablefish reported an increase in the survey index and had projected an increase in biomass in `r YEAR`, they saw a decrease in estimated spawning biomass and recommended that the Allowable Biological Catch for `r YEAR+1` stay constant from `r YEAR`. The recommended Federal $ABC$ for the `r YEAR+1` commercial longline sablefish fishery is `r formatC(fed$ABC_thisyr, format="d", big.mark=",")` tons, a `r formatC(abs(fed$perc_change), format="f", digits=1)`% `r fed$eval` from the `r YEAR` $ABC$ of `r formatC(fed$ABC_lastyr, format="d", big.mark=",")` tons after whale depredation was accounted for (Hanselman et al. `r YEAR`). This reflects a 45% reduction from the maximum permissable $ABC$ (Hanselman et al. `r YEAR`). This recommendation was accepted by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council in December `r YEAR`. Here a `r perc_change`% incease in the $ABC$ is recommended for the NSEI. As in past years, it is important to remember that the $F_{ABC}$ presented in the summary table above is not directly comparable to the Federal harvest policy of $F_{40\%}$, because the methods used to assess abundance and determine $F$ values are different.

```

The mark-recapture study forms the foundation for current sablefish management in Chatham Strait. The most commonly used method for abundance estimation and the model that was used for many years by ADF&G is the Chapman estimator:

$$N = \frac{(K_0+1)(n+1)}{k+1}-1,$$

where $N$ is the estimated population abundance, $K_0$ is the total number of individuals tagged in the population, $n$ is the number of individuals checked for marks at the time of recapture, and $k$ is the number of marked individuals out of $n$. The variance of the abundance estimate is calculated as

$$\mbox{var}(N) = \frac{(K_0+1)(n+1)(K_0-k)(n-k)}{(k+1)^2(k+2)}.$$

A description of all model variables is found in `r tbl('varb_defns', display = "cite")`, and a summary of the mark-recapture data since 2005 is found in `r tbl('tag_sum', display = "cite")`. The ADF&G did not conduct a tagging survey in 2011, 2014, or 2016 due to budget restrictions. In the equations above, $n$ and $k$ represent the combined observed samples and marks in the fishery and survey, and tags captured in other fisheries or outside Chatham before or during the survey ($D_0$ and $D_{srv}$) are deducted from $K_0$ prior to estimation (`r tbl('tag_sum', display = "cite")`). 

There are four primary assumptions integral to the Chapman estimator, which have been discussed in detail in previous iterations of this memo (Williams and Van Kirk 2017, Dressel 2009, Mueter 2010). Briefly, these assumptions include a closed population (no movement in or out of the study area), equal probability of recapture, sufficient time between marking and recapture to allow for marked individuals to be randomly distributed throughout the unmarked population, and no tag loss or errors. Violations to these assumptions can be mitigated through study design, treatment of data, and changes to model structure. A combination of approaches were utlized to meet or relax these assumptions including:

1.  Potential differences in the size selectivity between the pot survey and longline survey and fishery were accounted for by (1) estimating growth between May and August using known length recaptured individuals, (2) comparing the cumulative length distributions between tagged and recaptured fish, and (3) adjusting sample sizes accordingly. Despite the differences in selectivity between pot and longline gear, minimal differences in the cumulative length distributions between marked and recaptured since 2005 were found, which suggests that in most years the size distribution tagged in the pot survey well represents the the fishery (`r fig('cum_length', display = "cite")`). The 2018 survey was a notable exception; the size distribution of the recaptured fish was much larger than that of the released (`r fig('cum_length', display = "cite")`). A record number of fish were tagged in 2018, and catch rates were so high that the number of pots fished in a set was reduced from 40 to 20. Because a large number of small fish were tagged and none of the tags were recovered in the fishery, `r tags_removed` tags were removed prior to analysis (the difference between $K$ and $K_0$ in `r tbl('tag_sum', display = "cite")`). 

2.  To assess the assumption that there is sufficient time between marking and recapture to allow for tagged individuals to be randomly distributed, movement in the population between statistical areas was explored. Results suggest that the population is sufficiently mixed across study years (`r fig('movement_mat', display = "cite")`). These findings are consistent with Mueter (2010) and lend support to the current study design of the mark-recapture project.

3.  A suite of alternative models that are stratified by time were developed in order to account for natural and fishing mortality, potential changes in the probability of recapture, and tag loss from other fisheries or outside the NSEI. This allows for greater precision in the estimates of abundance, as each time-period compensates for changes in $K$, $n$, and $k$.

4.  To account for potential violations of the closed population assumption, two of the alternative models estimate an additional parameter for migration (see Models 2 and 4, `r tbl('mods', display = "cite")`).

5.  To further address a potential change in capture probability through time, two of the alternative models incorporate fishery CPUE data to account for seasonal changes in catch rates or fish abundance (see Models 3 and 4, `r tbl('mods', display = "cite")`).

The mark-recapture models used in this analysis are based on analyses by Mueter (2010). Population estimates from a simple Chapman estimator (Model 0) are compared with estimates from several extensions of a stratified Peterson estimator that account for changes in capture probability through time, natural and fishing mortality, migration, and seasonal trends in catch rates. These alternative model structures (Models 1-4) are implemented in the Bayesian open source software JAGS 4.3.0 (Depaoli 2016). The Bayesian approach is preferred, because it allows the incorporation of prior information and additional parameter uncertainty into the model. Previous methods used arbitrary break points (e.g. 5 or 10 days) to define temporal strata throughout the fishing season (Mueter 2010, Van Kirk 2016). Here cumulative catch over time is used to define temporal strata. A combination of convergence criteria, deviance information criterion (DIC; Spiegelhalter et al. 2002), and an examination of seasonal trends in abundance was used in model selection. 

## Model 1: Time-stratified Petersen estimator

The abundance of sablefish in Chatham Strait in a given time period $N_i$ was assumed to follow a normal distribution with an uninformed prior (precision = $1\times10^{-12}$) centered on past assessments' forecast of abundance.

For any given time period $i$ (see `r tbl('varb_defns', display = "cite")` for variable definitions):

$$K_i = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
(K_0-D_0)*\mbox{exp}(-M*t_i) &\mbox{i=1}\\
(K_{i-1}-k_{i-1}-D_{i-1})*\mbox{exp}(-M*t_i) &\mbox{i>1}
\end{array}\right.$$.

$$N_i = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
(N_i*\mbox{exp}(-M*t_i) &\mbox{i=1}\\
(N_{i-1}-C_{i-1})*\mbox{exp}(-M*t_i) &\mbox{i>1}
\end{array}\right.$$

The probability that a sablefish caught in a given time period is marked $p_i$ is informed by the ratio of marks in the population to the total population at that time ${K_i}/{N_i}$. Each $p_i$ is assumed to follow a beta prior distribution $p_i=beta(\alpha,\beta)$, where $\alpha=({K_i}/{N_i})*x$, $\beta=(1-{K_i}/{N_i})/x$, and a large $x$ indicates confidence in ${K_i}/{N_i}$. Because $N_i$ was previously assumed to follow vague normal prior, $p_i$ was assigned an informed prior by setting $x$ equal to 10,000.

In a given time period, the likelihood of recapturing $k$ marked sablefish given $n$ sampled individuals follows a binomial distribution, where

$$Pr(k|n,p)=\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}.$$

The final estimate and credible interval reported for $N$ is the mean $N$ across all time periods.

## Model 2: Accounting for movement

Following Mueter (2010), the time-stratified Peterson estimator was extended by estimating a parameter for net migration $r$. If $r$ is positive, it indicates that there was net positive movement of sablefish into Chatham Strait during the fishery. Conversely, a negative $r$ would suggest net movement out of Chatham during the fishery. Following Mueter (2010), $r$ was assigned a vague normal prior distribution, centered at +5,000 individuals (precision = $1\times10^{-12}$). This parameter is incorporated into the model with the addition of $r$ into the abundance equation from Model 1:

$$N_i=(N_{i-1}-C_{i-1})*\mbox{exp}(-M*t_i)+r*t_i.$$

## Models 3 and 4: Including fishery CPUE data

As an extension to the above models and to account for seasonal trends in abundance and fishing effort, fishery CPUE data was included in the model. An examination of fishery CPUE annually since 2005 (omitted for brevity), shows slight increasing or decreasing linear trends in fishery CPUE over the fishing season. This suggests a change in fish abundance or density throughout the fishing season and that the direction of this change is variable between years. Fishery CPUE in a given time period, defined as number of sablefish per 1,000 hooks, was back-calculated using mean fish weight in the fishery and weight of the landing from fish tickets. 

Versions of Models 1 and 2 were adapted to include fishery CPUE data (Models 3 and 4 in `r tbl('mods', display = "cite")`) following the methods in Mueter (2010). Fishery CPUE was assumed proportional to total sablefish abundance in each time period 

$$CPUE_i = q * N_i,$$

where catchability $q$ is the constant of proportionality. These models were fit to the mark-recapture and fishery CPUE data by maximizing the combined likelihood, which consisted of a binomial likelihood component for the mark-recapture data and a normal likelihood for the fishery CPUE data. Both likelihood components received equal weights in the combined likelihood, thus fishery CPUE and mark-recapture data contribute equally to the parameter estimation.

## Results and model selection

A total of 32 models (4 models $\times$ 8 time periods) were fit for each tagging survey year from 2005 to `r YEAR` (11 distinct years). Trace plots were examined visually, and a convergence diagnostic was used to test the convergence of MCMC chains (Gelman and Rubin 1992). All models converged except for versions of Models 3 and 4 with fewer than 4 time periods. Models 3 and 4 used fishery CPUE data to estimate $q$, so these models require more observations of CPUE (i.e. more time periods) to converge. Therefore, Models 3 and 4 with fewer than 4 time periods were omitted from further consideration.

A combination of DIC and visual examination of trends in abundance estimates were used in the remaining model selection. A tradeoff existed between the number of time periods $P$ and the ability to accurately describe seasonal trends. Consistent with last year, a comparison of Models 1-4 across a range of time periods $P$ showed that the final estimate of $N$ stabilizes after $P\geq6$ for most years (Sullivan et al. 2017). Because capturing this temporal trend was a motivating factor in the development of these models, models with $P<6$ were eliminated, and the remaining models were compared using DIC. 

```{r top_mods, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}

read_csv(paste0("output/top_models_", YEAR, ".csv")) -> top_mods

top_mods %>% 
  select(Model = model, Estimate, `Upper CI` = q975,
         `Lower CI` = q025, Deviance = deviance, 
         `Parameter penalty` = parameter_penalty, `delta DIC` = delta_DIC) -> top_mods
  
top_mods[c(2:4)] <- lapply(top_mods[,c(2:4)], prettyNum, trim=TRUE, big.mark=",")
top_mods[c(5:7)] <- lapply(top_mods[,c(5:7)], formatC, format="f", digits = 2)

```

The models with the most support in all years were Models 1 and 2 by DIC ($\Delta{DIC}\leq2$) (Burnham and Anderson 2003). The point estimate and credible interval for $N$ for the top candidate models for `r YEAR` are found in `r tbl('top_mods', display = "cite")`. The simple Chapman estimator (Model 0) does not account for natural or fishing mortality or changes in abundance throughout the season but provides a comparable estimate of abundance to Models 1-4 (`r tbl('top_mods', display = "cite")`). Although Model 2 had statistical support via DIC, the resultant abundance estimates and variance from Model 2 were greater than Model 1 (`r tbl('top_mods', display = "cite")`). The estimates and credible intervals for net migration ($r$) were wide for all years, and the direction of net migration (positive or negative) was inconsistent across years (`r fig('net_migration', display = "cite")`). Interestingly, Model 2 results in `r YEAR` suggest record migration into Chatham, which could account for the rapid increase in abundance since 2016. Model 4, which includes migration and CPUE data, fit better than Model 3, which was unable to capture the increasing trend in CPUE over the fishery (`r fig('mod3_vs_mod4', display = "cite")`). 

Model 1 with $P=6$ was selected for the `r YEAR+1` forecast. Retrospective analysis shows Model 1 abundance estimates follow a similar trend and general magnitude as past model estimates (`r fig('retro', display = "cite")`). 

# Section IV: Determining Allowable Biological Catch

Using the abundance estimate in `r YEAR` ($N_{`r YEAR`}$ in the equation below), the vulnerable abundance-at-age for ages 2+ in `r YEAR+1` was obtained by partitioning the estimated exploited abundance into cohorts using commercial fishery age compositions and applying fishing and natural mortality:

$$N_{`r YEAR+1`,s,a} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\frac{N_{`r YEAR`,s,a-1}p_{s,a-1}\phi_s}{S_{a-1,s}}\mbox{exp}(-Z_{`r YEAR`,s,a-1}) &a_{0}<a<a_{+}\\
\frac{N_{`r YEAR`,s,a-1}p_{s,a-1}\phi_s}{S_{a-1,s}}\mbox{exp}(-Z_{`r YEAR`,s,a-1})+\frac{N_{`r YEAR`,s,a}p_{s,a}\phi_k}{S_{a,s}}\mbox{exp}(-Z_{`r YEAR`,k,a}) &a=a_{+}
\end{array}\right.$$

where $p_{s,a}$ is the fishery age composition by sex $s$ in `r YEAR`, $\phi_s$ is the sex ratio in the fishery in `r YEAR`, and $S_{s,a}$ is the sex-specific fishery selectivity-at-age (Hanselman et al. `r YEAR`). 

Total instantaneous mortality-at-age $Z_{s,a}$ is the sum of fishing mortality $F_{s,a}$ and natural mortality $M$, which is assumed to be 0.10 (Johnson and Quinn 1998). The fully-selected fishing mortality used to calculate $ABC$ ($F_{ABC}$) is obtained from yield-per-recruit tables, and fixed to $F_{ABC}=F_{50\%}$, where $F_{50\%}$ corresponds to the $F$ that would reduce the spawning biomass to 50% of unfished levels. Biological inputs to the yield-per-recruit model included longline survey weight-at-age and estimated maturity from the longline survey (`r fig('bio_inputs', display = "cite")`).

Fishing mortality is modeled as a function of fishery selectivity $S_{s,a}$, retention probability $R_{s,a}$ (the age-specific probability of being landed given being caught), and discard mortality $\Omega$:

$$F_{s,a}=S_{s,a}(R_{s,a}+\Omega(1-R_{s,a}))F.$$

Discard mortality $\Omega$ is assumed to be 0.16, the discard mortality used in the Pacific halibut fishery (Gilroy and Stewart 2013). Pacific halibut are a reasonable proxy for sablefish because they are large-bodied, long-lived benthic fish that do not experience barotrauma. Retention probability by sex and age $R_{a,s}$ is informed by processor grade and price and defined as a function of weight, which is converted to age and sex using survey weight-at-age (`r fig('discard_mort', display = "cite")`). This method of accounting for discards shifts fishing mortality toward older ages, especially for males that are slower growing than females (`r fig('F_discards', display = "cite")`).

Using longline survey weight-at-age by sex $w_{s,a}$ from a weight-based von Bertalanffy growth model, a modified Baranov catch equation is used to calculate the $ABC$ in `r YEAR+1`:

$$ABC_{`r YEAR+1`}= \sum_{s=1}^{2}\sum_{a=2}^{a+}w_{s,a}(N_{`r YEAR+1`,s,a})\frac{R_{s,a}S_{s,a}F}{Z_{s,a}}(1-\mbox{exp}(-Z_{s,a})).$$

The biomass of discarded sablefish estimated to die with an assumed discard mortality of 0.16 $D_{`r YEAR+1`}$ is

$$D_{`r YEAR+1`}= \sum_{s=1}^{2}\sum_{a=2}^{a+}w_{s,a}(N_{`r YEAR+1`,s,a})\frac{\Omega S_{s,a}(1-R_{s,a})F}{Z_{s,a}}(1-\mbox{exp}(-Z_{s,a})).$$

The `r YEAR+1` $ABC$ is estimated to be `r ABC` round lb, and the discarded portion of the catch is `r discards` round lb (`r tbl('full_summary', display = "cite")`). `r fig('ABC_ts', display = "cite")` shows the `r YEAR+1` $ABC$ in the context of $ABC$s recommended by ADF&G since 2005.

# Section V: Future work and recommendations
  
1.  We recommend that data input and storage methods for the mark recovery and countback data be improved. The countback data are stored in spreadsheets on the network drive. The spreadsheets are heavily formatted, do not use consistent data types, and contain no metadata. Consequently, they are difficult to use, and easily lost or changed by anyone with network access.

2.  It is a continued priority for the Region I Groundfish Project and biometric team to develop and implement an integrated age-structured assessment for this stock. We recommend staff time be allocated to the continued development of the model outlined in the Appendix to this document.

3.  The tagging survey is integral to understanding the population dynamics of sablefish in Chatham Strait and providing sound management advice. Consequently, we recommend the continuation of an annual tagging survey.
