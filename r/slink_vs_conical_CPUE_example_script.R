#We've got two groups of fish caught in two gears.  We fished 100 pots for each 
# group.
#in the first group we caught 500 fish that averaged 50 cm in length: 
set.seed(1457)
fish1<-round(rnorm(500,50,10),0); hist(fish1)
CPUE1<-500/100
#In the second group we caught 450 fish that averaged 54 cm in length: 
fish2<-round(rnorm(450,54,7),0); hist(fish2)
CPUE2<-450/100

#This is a simple example.  You should calculate the CPUE for each pot and then
#calculate the average CPUE across all pots/sets and get the variance and standard deviation
# which will allow you to see if they are significantly different.  You can repeat that at
# the set level as well.  

#In this simple example we know we caught more fish in group 1, but we want to know
# did we catch more fish of all length categories or did we just catch more small 
# fish and the same number of big fish?
